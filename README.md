# **Portfolio Enrichment Piece**

## **What is PEP?**

You will produce a written ***or*** recorded piece presenting a "deep dive" into a technical topic _**not** explicitly covered_ in the FSA curriculum. This is a great way to show off your tech knowledge and communication skills of technical topics, possibly to a non-technical audience. Your completed PEP can be added to your resume/portfolio as a nice enhancement that will set you apart from other applicants!

## **Format**

You will produce an individual report of one of the following formats:

* Exploration of new technology, or comparison of multiple technologies (e.g, React Hooks vs Redux)
* Technology Tutorial
* Data Structure/Algorithm walkthrough
* Applied use-case of ADT/Algo
* Overview of Industry Best Practices (DevOps, Agile, etc.)

### Guidelines

* Written PEPs should be ~1000 words in length and published to Medium
* Recorded PEPs should be ~5 minutes in length and published to Youtube (unlisted)

### Review

While PEP is an individual assignment, you will be assigned to a review group of ~3 students with which to share and review your PEPs. Peer reviewers are also responsible for leaving upvotes/positive comments on their groupmates' published PEPs!
